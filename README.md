# Computational-thinking

Computational thinking is a problem-solving technique that imitates the process computer programmers go through when writing computer programmes and algorithms.

There are many ways of solving a problem:

- simulation
- enumeration (listing all causes)
- trial and error
- theoretical approach
- creative solutions
- etc

  Simulation: designing a model of a real system to understand the behaviour of the system, and to evaluate various situations.

  Queueing problems:

  - Creating optimum number for different questions e.g checkouts at a new supermarket

Enumeration: Finding solutions to anagrams

Alternative approaches:

- theoretical approach

Creative solution: Approaching in new ways

Stratigies for algorithim design:

- Design and conquer
  - This involves finding a solution to a sequence of smaller related problems until the instance is small enough to be solved directly.
  - A good example of this is the binary search algorithm. We will revisit in a later lesson.
